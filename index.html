  <p>Do you sometimes wake up groggy? Waking up on the wrong side of the bed may be less about how much shuteye you get
    and
    more about where you are in your sleep cycle when you awaken. Humans experience multiple cycles while asleep, and
    waking in the middle of the wrong one could cause drowsiness. Therefore, you should know how much rest you need to
    avoid waking mid-cycle, and the good news is we are here to help. We’ll walk you through how to use our sleep
    calculator to maximize your rest. Plus, we’ll go over what happens while you sleep, why quality rest is important,
    and
    more.</p>
  <h1>Stages of Sleep</h1>
  <p>There are four <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12148-sleep-basics">stages of sleep</a> [1],
    and they are divided into two phases, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid
    eye
    movement (non-REM). The first three stages involve non-REM sleep, while the fourth and final stage is REM sleep.
    During a cycle, you will move through each of these four stages, starting with Stage 1 of non-REM slumber and ending
    with REM. Therefore, to finish a full cycle, you need to complete all four stages. Once you are done with REM, you
    then move on to another cycle, repeating this pattern throughout the night. Each cycle lasts for about 90 to 110
    minutes.</p>

  <h1>What Happens During Each Stage</h1>
  <p>Stage 1 is a light rest lasting roughly 5 to 10 minutes. During this time, your eye movement slows, and your
    muscles
    start relaxing. You may also experience hypnic jerking, a sudden muscle contraction. The second stage is when your
    brain waves and heart rate slow down, body temperature drops, and eye movement ceases. The second stage typically
    lasts <a href="https://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/science/what/sleep-patterns-rem-nrem">10 to 25</a> [2]
    minutes. You are in a deep slumber during the third non-REM stage, and you’re likely to feel
    disoriented if awakened. Furthermore, you generate very slow brain waves, which is why this stage is also known as
    slow-wave. Lastly, you have no eye or muscle movement.</p>
  <h1>Rem Cycle - The Most Important One</h1>
  <p>The final stage, REM, is when your brain waves begin to quicken again as you leave deep sleep. Your heart rate and
    blood pressure also start to rise, and your breathing becomes more rapid. As the name suggests, this stage is marked
    by faster eye movements as well. REM is also when people usually dream. To avoid physically acting out these dreams,
    though, your legs and arms remain in a state of paralysis. According to <a
      href="https://valleysleepcenter.com/3-things-you-should-know-about-rem-sleep/">Valley Sleep Center</a> [3], REM is
    highly
    important because it “stimulates the areas of your brain that are essential in learning and making or retaining
    memories.” As you cycle through multiple REM stages during the night, they will first last around 10 minutes and
    then
    get increasingly longer. The amount of REM slumber you need depends on your age. For example, babies and young
    children need the most, and this amount decreases as you move into adolescence and adulthood.</p>
  <h1>How to Use Sleep Calculator</h1>
  <p>The calculator is designed to help you wake up during Stage 1, the lightest rest. There are three ways to use this
    calculator to generate your custom bedtime duration. The first option is to input the time you need to wake up. The
    tool will then provide you with recommended bedtimes. The second option is to input that you’d like to go to bed
    right
    now, and the calculator will show you when to wake up. Thirdly, you can choose to input when you’d like to go to bed
    later that night, and the tool will give you recommended wake-up times.</p>
  <h1>The Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Your Body</h1>
  <p>Insufficient rest can have a significant impact on your well-being. Not only can it impair your physical health,
    but
    it can also affect your emotional and cognitive health. One of the primary effects of inadequate shuteye is daytime
    fatigue. Furthermore, feeling too tired during the day increases your chances of getting into an accident. According
    to <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-effects-of-sleep-deprivation">Johns
      Hopkins Medicine</a> [4], 6,000 fatal car crashes each year are due to drowsy driving. Other physical
    ramifications include an increased risk of illness, heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, colorectal cancer,
    and type 2 diabetes. Poor rest is also linked to an increased of dementia, negative moods, and difficulty
    concentrating.</p>

  <h1>How to Improve Your Sleep Quality</h1>
  <p>If you feel like your slumber is subpar, you can do things to promote better rest. The first tip is to maintain a
    consistent bedtime and wake-up time, including weekends. The great news is you can use the calculator to help
    determine your ideal schedule and then stick to that. Secondly, avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine as they can
    disrupt your rest. Furthermore, going to bed full or hungry can also affect your rest. If you take naps, don’t doze
    off too late in the day or for more than 30 minutes. Physical activity should also help you rest better, so consider
    going out for a run or walk if you need an afternoon recharge. Make sure your bedroom is conducive to quality rest
    by
    keeping it cool, quiet, and dark. Lastly, help alleviate stress that can keep you up by establishing a relaxing
    nightly routine before bed, such as reading a book or drinking hot tea.</p>

  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <h2>How many hours of sleep is recommended?</h2>
  <p>Although the calculator can help you wake up during a lighter slumber, that’s not to say you should actively pursue
    fewer hours of shuteye than recommended by the medical community. Experts suggest that adults get between <a
      href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-much-sleep-do-i-need/">7 and 9</a>
    [5]
    hours of slumber each night, which correlates to 5 or 6 full cycles. However, this amount can vary depending on your
    health and personal circumstances. For instance, if you are recovering from a cold, you will likely doze off longer
    than you would normally. Babies, children, and teens should get even more slumber. For example, a newborn baby needs
    between 14 and 17 hours of shuteye.</p>
  <h2>Is it normal to still feel tired after sleeping for 8 hours?</h2>
  <p>Yes, you can sleep for 8 hours and still feel tired. Even though you got the amount of rest that health experts
    recommend, you likely woke up toward the end of a sleep cycle. The length of these cycles can vary. We mentioned
    earlier that a complete cycle could last from 90 to 110 minutes. The duration of each stage can vary too, further
    affecting the cycle duration. Each person is different, and therefore, you cannot count down a cycle to the exact
    minute. Instead, these numbers represent a general observation from health experts to help people better understand
    how we rest.</p>

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>If you want to wake up more refreshed, the sleep calculator could be the solution of your dreams. While people
    rest,
    they move through four stages. The first three are non-REM, and the fourth is REM. Together, these four stages are a
    full cycle. The ideal time to wake up is during the first and lightest stage, and experts suggest adults get between
    5
    and 6 cycles, equating to 7 to 9 hours of shuteye. Along with the calculator, you can implement good habits to
    further
    improve your slumber. Your doctor will also thank you for prioritizing your sleep since this is vital to keeping
    your
    health in check.</p>
